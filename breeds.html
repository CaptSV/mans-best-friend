              <h4>French Bulldog</h4>
              <p>
                The French Bulldog resembles a Bulldog in miniature, except for
                the large, erect <q>bat ears</q> that are the breed's trademark
                feature. The head is large and square, with heavy wrinkles
                rolled above the extremely short nose. The body beneath the
                smooth, brilliant coat is compact and muscular. The bright,
                affectionate Frenchie is a charmer.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Temperament</strong>: playful, alert, adaptable, and

              <p>
                The sturdy, well-balanced Labrador Retriever can, depending on
                the sex, stand from 21.5 to 24.5 inches at the shoulder and
                weigh between 55 to 80 pounds. The dense, hard coat comes in
                yellow, black, and a luscious chocolate. The head is wide, the
                eyes glimmer with kindliness, and the thick, tapering
                <q>otter tail</q> seems to be forever signaling the breed's
                innate eagerness. Labs are famously friendly.

              <p>
                The Golden Retriever, an exuberant Scottish gundog of great
                beauty, stands among America's most popular dog breeds. They are
                serious workers at hunting and field work, as guides for the
                blind, and in search-and-rescue, enjoy obedience and other
                competitive events, and have an endearing love of life when not
                at work. The Golden Retriever is a sturdy, muscular dog of
                medium size, famous for the dense, lustrous coat of gold that
                gives the breed its name.

              <h4>German Shepherd Dog</h4>
              <p>
                Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the
                German Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble
                character and high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous,
                and steady, the German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.
                German Shepherd Dogs can stand as high as 26 inches at the
                shoulder and, when viewed in outline, presents a picture of
                smooth, graceful curves rather than angles. The natural gait is
                a free-and-easy trot, but they can turn it up a notch or two and
                reach great speeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Temperament</strong>: courageous, confident, and smart.

              <h4>Poodle</h4>
              <p>
                Whether Standard, Miniature, or Toy, and either black, white, or
                apricot, the Poodle stands proudly among dogdom's true
                aristocrats. Beneath the curly, low-allergen coat is an elegant
                athlete and companion for all reasons and seasons. Poodles come
                in three size varieties: Standards should be more than 15 inches
                tall at the shoulder; Miniatures are 15 inches or under; Toys
                stand no more than 10 inches. All three varieties have the same
                build and proportions.

              <h4>Dachshund</h4>
              <p>
                The famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, and
                bold, vivacious personality of the Dachshund have made him a
                superstar of the canine kingdom. Dachshunds come in two sizes
                and in three coat types of various colors and patterns. The word
                <q>icon</q> is terribly overworked, but the Dachshund with his
                unmistakable long-backed body, little legs, and big personality
                is truly an icon of purebred dogdom.
              </p>
              <p>

              <h4>Rottweiler</h4>
              <p>
                The Rottweiler is a robust working breed of great strength
                descended from the mastiffs of the Roman legions. A gentle
                playmate and protector within the family circle, the Rottie
                observes the outside world with a self-assured aloofness. A male
                Rottweiler will stand anywhere from 24 to 27 muscular inches at
                the shoulder; females run a bit smaller and lighter. .
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Temperament</strong>: loyal, loving, and confident
                guardian.

              <h4>Bulldog</h4>
              <p>
                Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog is a
                thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose
                <q>sourmug</q> face is the universal symbol of courage and
                tenacity. These docile, loyal companions adapt well to town or
                country. You can't mistake a Bulldog for any other breed. The
                loose skin of the head, furrowed brow, pushed-in nose, small
                ears, undershot jaw with hanging chops on either side, and the
                distinctive rolling gait all practically scream
                <q>I'm a Bulldog!</q> The coat, seen in a variety of colors and
                patterns, is short, smooth, and glossy.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Temperament</strong>: friendly, courageous, and calm.

              <h4>Beagle</h4>
              <p>
                Not only is the Beagle an excellent hunting dog and loyal
                companion, it is also happy-go-lucky, funny, and
                <q>thanks to its pleading expression</q> cute. They were bred to
                hunt in packs, so they enjoy company and are generally
                easygoing. There are two Beagle varieties: those standing under
                13 inches at the shoulder, and those between 13 and 15 inches.
                Both varieties are sturdy, solid, and 'big for their inches,' as
                dog folks say.
              </p>

                exercise, positive training, and a lot of love. GSP people call
                their aristocratic companions the <q>perfect pointer.</q> Male
                German Shorthaired Pointers stand between 23 and 25 inches at
