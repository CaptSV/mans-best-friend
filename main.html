        <p>
          The domestication of animals is considered one of the most important transitions in human history. The domestication of canines began roughly around 15,000 years ago where wolves and hunter-gathers were prominent in human survivability. Through domestication and genetic studies suggesting the grey wolf being the closest living relative to modern dogs.

          Fast forward to modern times, we have grown a bond strong enough to these animals to have them described as <q><em>Man's Best Friend</em></q>. A description first discovered used by Frederick II, King of Prussia (1740–1786) and popularized from a poem by Ogden Nash. Dogs have been used in various roles such as hunting, herding, protection, and companionship. They have been bred into various breeds, each with their own unique characteristics and traits.

          One of the earliest citations in the US traced back to a poem published on <cite>The New-York Literary Journal, Volume 4, 1821</cite> by C.S Winkle. The poem goes as follows: 
          <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man%27s_best_friend">
            <em>
              The faithful dog – why should I strive <br>
              To speak his merits, while they live <br>
              In every breast, and man’s best friend <br>
              Does often at his heels attend.
            </em>
          </blockquote>
          To properly understand the bond between humans and dogs, we must first understand how humans and dogs have evolved together. Dogs evolved from wolves and have bonded with humans through mutual benefit. Theory suggests that due to environmental changes, humans and dogs took shelter in same caves and hunted together. This bond has been passed down through generations and has evolved into the bond we see today.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we now have to wonder, How Did Dogs Evolve To Be Loyal to Humans? - While some aspects were already stated, experts say that the relationship between the two dates back prehistory times. Early humans provided food and shelter, while dogs offered protection and companionship. Over time, this relationship deepened, leading to their unfaltering loyalty.
        </p>
        <p>
          As time continued, humans began devling into selective breeding for certain traits and behaviors that they found useful. This led to the creation of various breeds that we see today. Each breed has its own unique characteristics and traits that make them suitable for certain roles. For example, the Border Collie is known for its herding abilities, while the German Shepherd is known for its protective instincts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, many dogs are considered companions and part of the family. Dogs reciprocate by offering emotional support to their families in the form of unlimited nuzzles, licks, and tail wags. In addition, research has shown that owning a pet may even offer health benefits for people, such as an improved mood and reduced stress. Regular walks around the neighborhood with a dog may also provide a boost to cardiovascular health.
        </p>
        <p>
          A dog's loyalty and unconditional love can be displayed through Homer's Odyssey, where the dog Argos waited for his master, Odysseus, to return home for 20 years. When Odysseus finally returned, Argos recognized him and wagged his tail before passing away. This story is a testament to the bond between humans and dogs and the loyalty that dogs have for their owners.
